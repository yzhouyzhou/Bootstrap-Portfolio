                Daily Joke: <br>
                Mr. and Mrs. Brown had two sons. One was named Mind Your Own Business & the other was named Trouble.
                One day the two boys decided to play hide and seek. Trouble hid while Mind Your Own Business counted to
                one hundred.
                Mind Your Own Business began looking for his brother behind garbage cans and bushes.
                Then he started looking in and under cars until a police man approached him and asked,
                "What are you doing?" "Playing a game," the boy replied. "What is your name?" the officer questioned.
                "Mind Your Own Business." Furious the policeman inquired, "Are you looking for trouble?!"
                The boy replied, "Why, yes."
